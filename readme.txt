This is a Very Simple Todo App built using React and Bootstrap. It consists of three components: 

-App: the parent component	
-Input: child component consisting of a user text input, priority dropdown select 		menu and a submit button
-Add: child component which displays the list of submitted tasks and allows the 		user to edit, delete and/or check off individual tasks, determined in the render function by several chained ternary statements
